## What is it?
Pagan is an opus editor that can read/write midi files. It exists because I wanted to be able to write music in a way that represents how I look at music rather than try to translate musical ideas to and from a different structure, like a game of broken telephone.
It may be for you, it may not. You do you.

## Building the APK
At the moment, no release are available through any app store though v0.1.0 should be available in the coming few days (as of 2023-06-09). If you can't wait until then and you don't trust the .apk, the source builds correctly with gradle.
